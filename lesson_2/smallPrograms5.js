//Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays.
// The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array,
// while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.
// e.g. merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

// You may assume that both array arguments have the same number of elements.


/* pseudocode casual problem 5:

# given two arrays of numbers
GOAL => merging the arrays, while numbers from arr1 gets assigned to odd indexes and from arr2 to even indexes.
=>      merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

- function that takes two arrays as arguments.
- create new empty array to store the elements one by one.
- looping over the arrays (2 loops)
(since both arrays have the same length, one loop would suffice but upon manipulation of an array, may cause errors)
- add the current element of the array's iteration to the empty array, starting with the element of arr1 then arr2.
â€“ return new array
- log function invocation to the console to confirm if it works.
